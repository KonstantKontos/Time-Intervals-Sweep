Time-Intervals-Sweep
====================

An Objective-C implementation of a sweep algorithm and a priority queue.

Sample use: Having a set of calendar events marked as 'available' and another set marked as 'unavailable'.

From these two sets derive a final set of time intervals that are marked as 'available'.
